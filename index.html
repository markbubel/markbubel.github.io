            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>I work across the entire product design process</h3>
            <p>I’m comfortable leading and working through the entire product design process, including research to find product opportunities and understand needs to designing concepts, prototypes, and production-ready interfaces.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>But my enjoyment comes from designing</h3>
            <p>My core, technical interests and skills as a designer are focused on designing products that feel considered with a high level of interaction and visual craft.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I have some technical skills, too</h3>
            <p>I have formal, academic training in computer science + my first job was a front-end developer. This gives me an edge over other designers as I work well with (and understand) engineers, QA, and scrum masters.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I want to have a positive impact</h3>
            <p>I’m most interested in how design contributes to better healthcare for all. I care—deeply—about my responsibility to design products that create better digital health experiences—for everyone. You'll see this belief throughout my work.</p>
