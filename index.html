    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>I work across the entire product design process</h3>

        <h3>But my enjoyment comes from designing</h3>
        <p>My core, technical interests and skills as a designer are focused on designing products that feel considered with a high level of interaction and visual craft.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>I have some technical skills, too</h3>
        <p>I have some formal, academic training in computer science, and I was a front-end developer during my first job. This gives me an edge over other designers as I work well with (and understand) engineers, QA, and scrum masters.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>I want to have a positive impact</h3>
        <p>I’m most interested in how design contributes to better healthcare for all. I care—deeply—about my responsibility to design products that create better digital health experiences—for everyone. You'll see this belief throughout my work.</p>
