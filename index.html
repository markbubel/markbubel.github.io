            <h2>About me</h2>
            <section class="about-me-a">
                <p>In my role as a Senior UX Designer, I lead across the full product design lifecycle—from uncovering opportunities through research to shaping concepts, prototypes, and production-ready interfaces.</p>
                <p>I care deeply about craft. My focus is on designing products that balance clarity, usability, and visual detail, with interaction patterns that feel natural and considered.</p>
                <p>I also bring a technical foundation. With some formal training in computer science and early experience as a front-end developer, I work fluently with engineers, QA, and delivery teams to bring ideas to life.</p>
                <p>For the past several years, my work has centered on healthcare, where thoughtful design directly improves people’s experiences. I’m motivated by the responsibility to build digital products that are clear, humane, and impactful.</p>
